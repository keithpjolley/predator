      <p> This model represents an ecosystem of
        a population of "prey", like rabbits, and "predators", like
        coyotes. As the number of prey increases then the number of
        predators will increas because there's more food for them. As the 
        number of predators increase then the number of prey being eaten also
        increases, which decreases their total population. This puts pressure
        on the predators because now there's less food for them to eat so their
        numbers start decreasing, which allows the number of prey to increase.
        And so the cycle continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        There needs to be a balance between the predators and prey for the ecosystem
        to be in balance. If the two species are not in harmony, like too many predators
        being born, then both species can go extinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sliders represent the relative likelyhoods of births or deaths of the population.
        <ul>
          <li>"bh" is the birthrate of the prey.</li>
          <li>"dh" is the probability of prey being eaten by the predators.</li>
          <li>"bp" is the probability of predators giving birth after eating.</li>
          <li>"dp" is the probability of the a predator dying.</li>
          <li>"n" is the number of generations to display.

        This is a phase diagram of the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.
        The math behind this is explained in Chapter 2 of this book:
